/// \section intro Program Introduction
/// The <b>Shapes Project</b> is an educational application designed to illustrate object-oriented programming concepts, particularly focusing on inheritance and polymorphism. It provides a simple framework for managing geometric shapes such as circles and squares.
///
/// The project consists of three main classes:
/// - <b>Shape</b>: The base class representing a generic geometric shape. It provides functionality for setting and retrieving the name and color of a shape, as well as calculating its perimeter, area, and overall dimension.
///
/// - <b>Circle</b>: A derived class inheriting from the Shape class, representing a circle shape. It includes methods for setting and retrieving the radius of the circle, as well as calculating its perimeter and area.
///
/// - <b>Square</b>: Another derived class from Shape, representing a square shape. Similar to Circle, it provides methods for setting and retrieving the side length of the square, along with calculating its perimeter and area.
///
/// Through this project, students can learn how to design and implement class hierarchies using inheritance, utilize polymorphism to work with objects of different types through a common interface, and understand the practical application of object-oriented principles in real-world scenarios.
///
/// Major Doxygen features demonstrated in this project include:
/// 
/// - Project/Application description and documentation on the main page
/// - Commenting classes and methods using Doxygen
/// - Ignoring source code comments in C or C++ style while constructing project documentation
///
/// External links can also be included in Doxygen comments, such as:
/// - <A target=blank HREF="http://www.example.com/">Example Website</A>

/// \section funfacts Fun Facts and Features
/// - The project includes dynamic memory allocation for managing objects of Circle and Square classes.
/// - The Shape class serves as the foundation for polymorphic behavior across different geometric shapes.
/// - Doxygen comments provide comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and maintenance of the codebase.
/// - Project was done alone as a group member left
/// -Project used GIT & GITUHB
